2.Our client and server are both working to our knowledge. We had some issues for a while with the timeout and detecting if a client had disconnected but we were able to resolve these issues. The timeout we had help from the FAQ then had to figure out how and where to implement it. The disconnection issue we finally figured out to use the return from send to check for closed sockets.
3.We tested our code with multiple games of multiple clients as well as with other people. We tested sending lots of garbage and invalid words as well as letting clients timeout. We also tested with a perfect game of only valid words to make sure the game was working in the best case scenario.
4. The most challenging aspects were the timeout, trie implementation and checking for disconnected clients. For timeout, we were unaware of how to test this without having the client make blocking calls to test connection. We were also just struggling in general with implementing the trie to work with our system.
